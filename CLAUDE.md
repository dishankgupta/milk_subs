- Linting: `pnpm lint` (ESLint compliant)
- Form validation: Prevents invalid data entry
- Database constraints: Proper foreign key relationships
- Authentication: Protected routes with middleware

## Database Operations Guidelines

**CRITICAL: To optimize token usage and avoid context consumption:**

### Database Query Strategy
- **ALWAYS use Task tool with general-purpose agent** for any database schema exploration, table discovery, or structural analysis
- **NEVER use `mcp__supabase__list_tables` directly** - delegate to Task tool to preserve context
- **Reference CLAUDE.md schema documentation first** before making any live database calls
- **Use targeted SQL queries** with `mcp__supabase__execute_sql` for specific data operations only

### Schema Reference (Quick Access)
**16 Tables Overview:**
- **Core**: customers, products, routes, base_subscriptions, modifications, daily_orders, deliveries, payments, product_pricing_history, sales
- **Invoice System**: invoice_metadata, invoice_line_items, invoice_payments, unapplied_payments, opening_balance_payments, gst_calculations
- **Functions**: calculate_customer_outstanding(), update_invoice_status(), getEffectiveOpeningBalance()
- **Views**: customer_outstanding_summary

### When to Use Live Database Calls
- ✅ Specific data queries (`SELECT * FROM customers WHERE...`)
- ✅ Data modifications (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)
- ✅ Function calls (`SELECT calculate_customer_outstanding(...)`)
- ❌ Schema exploration (use Task tool instead)
- ❌ Table structure discovery (use CLAUDE.md reference above)
- ❌ Column listing (reference existing code patterns)

### Context Preservation Rules
1. **Schema Discovery**: Always delegate to Task tool
2. **Data Operations**: Use direct MCP calls for efficiency
3. **Code References**: Use existing server actions as schema reference
4. **Documentation**: This CLAUDE.md file contains complete schema information

## Deployment Notes

- Remember to use MCP servers as per your need.
- IMPORTANT - All Linear issues have to be created and updated in the Milk Subs - Dairy Management System Project in Linear. URL is https://linear.app/dishank/project/milk-subs-dairy-business-management-system-638a16f66b40
