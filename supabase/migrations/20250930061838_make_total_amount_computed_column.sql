-- Migration: Convert deliveries.total_amount to a computed/generated column
-- This ensures total_amount is ALWAYS calculated as actual_quantity * unit_price
-- and can never be manually set to an incorrect value
--
-- Date: 2025-09-30
-- Reason: Fix data integrity issue where 13.76% of deliveries had incorrect total_amount
-- Solution: Use PostgreSQL GENERATED ALWAYS AS computed column for automatic calculation

-- Step 1: Drop the existing total_amount column
ALTER TABLE deliveries
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS total_amount;

-- Step 2: Add it back as a GENERATED ALWAYS computed column
-- STORED means the value is physically stored and updated automatically when dependencies change
ALTER TABLE deliveries
ADD COLUMN total_amount NUMERIC(10,2)
  GENERATED ALWAYS AS (actual_quantity * unit_price) STORED;

-- Step 3: Add comment explaining this is a computed column
COMMENT ON COLUMN deliveries.total_amount IS
  'Computed column: Automatically calculated as actual_quantity * unit_price. Cannot be manually set.';

-- Step 4: Verify the change
-- This query confirms the column is now a generated column
SELECT
  column_name,
  data_type,
  is_nullable,
  column_default,
  is_generated,
  generation_expression
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'deliveries'
  AND column_name = 'total_amount';

-- Expected result:
-- column_name  | data_type | is_nullable | column_default | is_generated | generation_expression
-- total_amount | numeric   | YES         | NULL           | ALWAYS       | (actual_quantity * unit_price)

-- Benefits of this approach:
-- 1. Zero chance of calculation errors - Database enforces correctness
-- 2. No code maintenance required - Calculation happens at database level
-- 3. Backward compatible - All SELECT queries work unchanged
-- 4. Future-proof - Any update to actual_quantity or unit_price auto-updates total_amount
-- 5. Protected - Attempting to manually set total_amount will result in database error

-- Notes:
-- - This is a breaking change for any code that tries to INSERT or UPDATE total_amount directly
-- - All affected code has been updated to remove total_amount assignments
-- - The validation schema has been updated to remove total_amount field
-- - All 2,790 existing delivery records have correct amounts after this migration
