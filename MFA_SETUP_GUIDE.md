## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Supabase MFA APIs Used

```typescript
// Enrollment
await supabase.auth.mfa.enroll({ factorType: 'totp' })

// Challenge
await supabase.auth.mfa.challenge({ factorId })

// Verify
await supabase.auth.mfa.verify({ factorId, challengeId, code })

// List Factors
await supabase.auth.mfa.listFactors()

// Unenroll
await supabase.auth.mfa.unenroll({ factorId })

// Check AAL
await supabase.auth.mfa.getAuthenticatorAssuranceLevel()
```

### Assurance Levels (AAL)

| Current | Next | Meaning |
|---------|------|---------|
| aal1 | aal1 | No MFA enrolled |
| aal1 | aal2 | MFA enrolled, needs verification |
| aal2 | aal2 | MFA verified ‚úÖ |

### Database Storage

All MFA data is stored in Supabase Auth's internal tables:
- `auth.mfa_factors` - Enrolled authenticators
- `auth.mfa_challenges` - Active verification challenges
- No changes to your `public` schema

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No TOTP factors found"

**Cause**: Factor didn't enroll properly
**Fix**: Refresh page, try enrolling again

### "Verification failed"

**Causes**:
1. Code expired (codes change every 30 seconds)
2. Time sync issue on phone
3. Wrong account selected in authenticator

**Fix**:
- Wait for new code to appear
- Ensure phone time is set to automatic
- Verify you're looking at correct account in app

### "Failed to start enrollment"

**Cause**: Supabase connection issue
**Fix**: Check internet connection, try again

### Can't Scan QR Code

**Fix**:
1. Click "Copy" to copy secret code
2. In Google Authenticator, tap +
3. Select "Enter a setup key"
4. Paste the secret manually

### Lost Phone & No Backup

**Emergency Fix** (requires database access):
```sql
-- WARNING: Only use in emergency
DELETE FROM auth.mfa_factors
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid-here';
```

Then user can log in normally and re-enable MFA.
