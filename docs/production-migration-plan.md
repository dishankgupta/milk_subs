## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Database Schema Migration (30 minutes)

#### Step 1.1: Backup Current Production Data
```sql
-- Create full database backup
pg_dump production_db > outstanding_migration_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

-- Create specific table backups
CREATE TABLE customers_backup AS SELECT * FROM customers;
CREATE TABLE invoice_metadata_backup AS SELECT * FROM invoice_metadata;
CREATE TABLE payments_backup AS SELECT * FROM payments;
```

#### Step 1.2: Apply Schema Migrations
```sql
-- Migration 1: Create new tables
CREATE TABLE invoice_line_items (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    invoice_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES invoice_metadata(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    line_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (line_type IN ('subscription', 'manual_sale', 'adjustment')),
    reference_id UUID,
    product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id),
    product_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    quantity DECIMAL(10,3) NOT NULL,
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    line_total DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    gst_rate DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0,
    gst_amount DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE invoice_payments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    invoice_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES invoice_metadata(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    payment_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES payments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    amount_allocated DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (amount_allocated > 0),
    allocation_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(invoice_id, payment_id)
);

CREATE TABLE unapplied_payments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    customer_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES customers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    payment_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES payments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    amount_unapplied DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (amount_unapplied > 0),
    reason VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'Awaiting invoice allocation',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Step 1.3: Enhance Existing Tables
```sql
-- Migration 2: Add columns to invoice_metadata
ALTER TABLE invoice_metadata ADD COLUMN invoice_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'draft' 
    CHECK (invoice_status IN ('draft', 'sent', 'paid', 'partially_paid', 'overdue', 'cancelled'));
ALTER TABLE invoice_metadata ADD COLUMN due_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE invoice_metadata ADD COLUMN amount_paid DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE invoice_metadata ADD COLUMN amount_outstanding DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE invoice_metadata ADD COLUMN last_payment_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

-- Migration 3: Add columns to payments
ALTER TABLE payments ADD COLUMN primary_invoice_id UUID REFERENCES invoice_metadata(id);
ALTER TABLE payments ADD COLUMN allocation_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'unapplied'
    CHECK (allocation_status IN ('unapplied', 'partially_applied', 'fully_applied'));
ALTER TABLE payments ADD COLUMN amount_applied DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE payments ADD COLUMN amount_unapplied DECIMAL(10,2);
```

#### Step 1.4: Create Database Functions
```sql
-- Migration 4: Create outstanding calculation function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_customer_outstanding(customer_uuid UUID)
RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2) AS $$
DECLARE
    outstanding_amount DECIMAL(10,2) := 0;
    opening_balance_amount DECIMAL(10,2) := 0;
    invoice_outstanding DECIMAL(10,2) := 0;
BEGIN
    SELECT COALESCE(opening_balance, 0) 
    INTO opening_balance_amount
    FROM customers 
    WHERE id = customer_uuid;
    
    SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount_outstanding), 0)
    INTO invoice_outstanding
    FROM invoice_metadata 
    WHERE customer_id = customer_uuid 
    AND invoice_status NOT IN ('paid', 'cancelled');
    
    outstanding_amount := opening_balance_amount + invoice_outstanding;
    
    RETURN outstanding_amount;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Migration 5: Create invoice status update function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_invoice_status(invoice_uuid UUID)
RETURNS VOID AS $$
DECLARE
    invoice_total DECIMAL(10,2);
    paid_amount DECIMAL(10,2);
    outstanding_amount DECIMAL(10,2);
    new_status VARCHAR(20);
BEGIN
    SELECT i.total_amount INTO invoice_total 
    FROM invoice_metadata i
    WHERE i.id = invoice_uuid;
    
    SELECT COALESCE(SUM(ip.amount_allocated), 0) 
    INTO paid_amount
    FROM invoice_payments ip
    WHERE ip.invoice_id = invoice_uuid;
    
    outstanding_amount := invoice_total - paid_amount;
    
    IF outstanding_amount <= 0 THEN
        new_status := 'paid';
    ELSIF paid_amount > 0 THEN
        new_status := 'partially_paid';
    ELSIF (SELECT i.due_date FROM invoice_metadata i WHERE i.id = invoice_uuid) < CURRENT_DATE THEN
        new_status := 'overdue';
    ELSE
        new_status := 'sent';
    END IF;
    
    UPDATE invoice_metadata 
    SET 
        amount_paid = paid_amount,
        amount_outstanding = outstanding_amount,
        invoice_status = new_status,
        last_payment_date = CASE 
            WHEN paid_amount > 0 THEN (
                SELECT MAX(p.payment_date)
                FROM invoice_payments ip
                JOIN payments p ON ip.payment_id = p.id
                WHERE ip.invoice_id = invoice_uuid
            )
            ELSE NULL
        END
    WHERE id = invoice_uuid;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### Step 1.5: Create Performance Views
```sql
-- Migration 6: Create optimized outstanding summary view
CREATE VIEW customer_outstanding_summary AS
SELECT 
    c.id as customer_id,
    c.billing_name,
    c.contact_person,
    r.name as route_name,
    COALESCE(c.opening_balance, 0) as opening_balance,
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE 
        WHEN i.invoice_status NOT IN ('paid', 'cancelled') 
        THEN i.amount_outstanding 
        ELSE 0 
    END), 0) as invoice_outstanding,
    COALESCE(c.opening_balance, 0) + COALESCE(SUM(CASE 
        WHEN i.invoice_status NOT IN ('paid', 'cancelled') 
        THEN i.amount_outstanding 
        ELSE 0 
    END), 0) as total_outstanding,
    COUNT(CASE 
        WHEN i.invoice_status NOT IN ('paid', 'cancelled') 
        THEN 1 
    END) as unpaid_invoice_count,
    MIN(CASE 
        WHEN i.invoice_status NOT IN ('paid', 'cancelled') 
        THEN i.invoice_date 
    END) as oldest_unpaid_date
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN routes r ON c.route_id = r.id
LEFT JOIN invoice_metadata i ON c.id = i.customer_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.billing_name, c.contact_person, r.name, c.opening_balance
HAVING COALESCE(c.opening_balance, 0) + COALESCE(SUM(CASE 
    WHEN i.invoice_status NOT IN ('paid', 'cancelled') 
    THEN i.amount_outstanding 
    ELSE 0 
END), 0) > 0;
```

### Phase 2: Data Migration (45 minutes)

#### Step 2.1: Migrate Outstanding Amounts to Opening Balance
```sql
-- Migration 7: Transfer existing outstanding amounts to opening balance
-- CRITICAL: This preserves existing outstanding amounts as opening balance
UPDATE customers 
SET opening_balance = COALESCE(opening_balance, 0) + COALESCE(outstanding_amount, 0)
WHERE outstanding_amount > 0;

-- Verify migration
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as customers_updated,
    SUM(outstanding_amount) as total_migrated_amount,
    SUM(opening_balance) as total_opening_balance
FROM customers 
WHERE outstanding_amount > 0;
```

#### Step 2.2: Initialize Payment Allocation Status
```sql
-- Migration 8: Initialize payment allocation tracking
UPDATE payments SET 
    amount_unapplied = amount - COALESCE(amount_applied, 0),
    allocation_status = CASE 
        WHEN COALESCE(amount_applied, 0) = 0 THEN 'unapplied'
        WHEN COALESCE(amount_applied, 0) < amount THEN 'partially_applied'
        ELSE 'fully_applied'
    END
WHERE amount_unapplied IS NULL;
```

#### Step 2.3: Initialize Invoice Status
```sql
-- Migration 9: Initialize invoice status and outstanding amounts
UPDATE invoice_metadata SET 
    amount_outstanding = CASE 
        WHEN COALESCE(amount_paid, 0) >= total_amount THEN 0
        ELSE total_amount - COALESCE(amount_paid, 0)
    END,
    invoice_status = CASE 
        WHEN COALESCE(amount_paid, 0) >= total_amount THEN 'paid'
        WHEN COALESCE(amount_paid, 0) > 0 THEN 'partially_paid'
        WHEN due_date < CURRENT_DATE THEN 'overdue'
        ELSE 'sent'
    END
WHERE invoice_status IS NULL OR invoice_status = 'draft';
```

### Phase 3: Application Deployment (15 minutes)

#### Step 3.1: Deploy Application Updates
- Deploy new application code with outstanding system integration
- Restart application services
- Verify application startup and database connectivity

#### Step 3.2: Remove Legacy Fields
```sql
-- Migration 10: Remove old outstanding_amount field (FINAL STEP)
-- Only after confirming application is working correctly
ALTER TABLE customers DROP COLUMN outstanding_amount;
```

### Phase 4: Post-Migration Validation (30 minutes)

#### Step 4.1: Data Integrity Validation
```sql
-- Validation 1: Verify all customers have correct outstanding calculations
SELECT 
    c.billing_name,
    c.opening_balance,
    cos.total_outstanding,
    calculate_customer_outstanding(c.id) as function_result,
    CASE 
        WHEN cos.total_outstanding = calculate_customer_outstanding(c.id) THEN 'PASS'
        ELSE 'FAIL'
    END as validation_status
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN customer_outstanding_summary cos ON c.id = cos.customer_id
ORDER BY validation_status DESC, total_outstanding DESC;

-- Validation 2: Verify invoice status consistency
SELECT 
    invoice_status,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_amount,
    SUM(amount_paid) as total_paid,
    SUM(amount_outstanding) as total_outstanding
FROM invoice_metadata
GROUP BY invoice_status;

-- Validation 3: Verify payment allocation consistency
SELECT 
    allocation_status,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(amount) as total_amount,
    SUM(amount_applied) as total_applied,
    SUM(amount_unapplied) as total_unapplied
FROM payments
GROUP BY allocation_status;
```

#### Step 4.2: Performance Validation
```sql
-- Performance Test: Outstanding dashboard query
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT * FROM customer_outstanding_summary 
ORDER BY total_outstanding DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- Performance Test: Customer outstanding calculation
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT calculate_customer_outstanding(id) 
FROM customers 
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Step 4.3: Application Functionality Validation
- [ ] Outstanding dashboard loads correctly
- [ ] Customer detail pages show correct outstanding amounts
- [ ] Payment entry works with invoice allocation
- [ ] Invoice generation creates proper line items
- [ ] Reports generate accurately

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback (if issues occur)

#### Step 1: Stop Application
```bash
# Stop application services immediately
sudo systemctl stop dairy-app
```

#### Step 2: Restore Database Schema
```sql
-- Restore customers table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers;
CREATE TABLE customers AS SELECT * FROM customers_backup;

-- Restore invoice_metadata table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS invoice_metadata;
CREATE TABLE invoice_metadata AS SELECT * FROM invoice_metadata_backup;

-- Restore payments table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS payments;
CREATE TABLE payments AS SELECT * FROM payments_backup;

-- Drop new tables
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS invoice_line_items CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS invoice_payments CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS unapplied_payments CASCADE;

-- Drop new functions and views
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS calculate_customer_outstanding(UUID);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_invoice_status(UUID);
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS customer_outstanding_summary;
```

#### Step 3: Deploy Previous Application Version
```bash
# Deploy previous application version
git checkout previous-stable-tag
# Restart application
sudo systemctl start dairy-app
```

### Partial Rollback (if only application issues)

#### Option A: Application-Only Rollback
- Keep database changes
- Deploy previous application version
- Outstanding amounts will fall back to opening_balance only

#### Option B: Data-Only Rollback
- Keep application changes  
- Restore outstanding_amount field from backup
- Update application configuration to use legacy system
