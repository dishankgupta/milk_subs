# Outstanding System Rework - Comprehensive Implementation Plan

## 1. Problem Analysis

### Current System Issues
The existing outstanding system has fundamental flaws:

1. **Disconnected from Invoices**: The `customers.outstanding_amount` field is updated independently of invoice generation
2. **No Invoice-Payment Tracking**: Payments are not linked to specific invoices
3. **Incorrect Business Logic**: Outstanding amounts exist without corresponding invoices
4. **No Audit Trail**: Cannot determine which transactions contributed to outstanding amounts
5. **Poor Reporting**: Outstanding reports don't reflect actual invoice-based debt

### Business Impact
- **Financial Inaccuracy**: Outstanding amounts don't represent actual unpaid invoices
- **Collection Problems**: Cannot track which specific invoices are unpaid
- **Audit Issues**: No clear trail from invoice to payment to outstanding
- **Customer Confusion**: Customers can't see which invoices they owe money on

## 2. Correct Business Logic Requirements

### Outstanding Definition
**Outstanding Amount = Sum of Unpaid/Partially Paid Invoices + Opening Balance**

Where:
- **Unpaid Invoice**: Invoice amount - payments allocated to that invoice = remaining balance
- **Opening Balance**: Historical debt from before system implementation (manually set)

### Business Rules
1. Outstanding amounts only exist when:
   - An invoice has been generated AND is not fully paid
   - OR there's a manually set opening balance
2. Payments must be allocated to specific invoices to reduce outstanding
3. Opening balances are treated as special "pre-system" invoices
4. Credit notes reduce outstanding amounts
5. Overpayments create credit balances (negative outstanding)

### Edge Cases
- **Payment before Invoice**: Hold as unapplied payment, allocate when invoice generated
- **Partial Payments**: Track payment allocation per invoice
- **Opening Balance Only**: Customer with opening balance but no invoices yet
- **Credit Notes**: Negative invoices that reduce outstanding
- **Overpayments**: Customer has paid more than they owe

## 3. Database Architecture

### 3.1 New Tables Required

#### `invoice_line_items`
```sql
-- Use Supabase MCP to apply this migration
CREATE TABLE invoice_line_items (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    invoice_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES invoice_metadata(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    line_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (line_type IN ('subscription', 'manual_sale', 'adjustment')),
    reference_id UUID, -- Links to daily_orders.id or sales.id
    product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id),
    product_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    quantity DECIMAL(10,3) NOT NULL,
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    line_total DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    gst_rate DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0,
    gst_amount DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### `invoice_payments`
```sql
-- Use Supabase MCP to apply this migration
CREATE TABLE invoice_payments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    invoice_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES invoice_metadata(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    payment_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES payments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    amount_allocated DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (amount_allocated > 0),
    allocation_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    -- Ensure no double allocation
    UNIQUE(invoice_id, payment_id)
);
```

#### `unapplied_payments`
```sql
-- Use Supabase MCP to apply this migration
CREATE TABLE unapplied_payments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    customer_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES customers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    payment_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES payments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    amount_unapplied DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (amount_unapplied > 0),
    reason VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'Awaiting invoice allocation',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 3.2 Modified Tables

#### `invoice_metadata` (Enhanced)
```sql
-- Use Supabase MCP to apply these migrations individually
-- Migration 1: Add invoice status column
ALTER TABLE invoice_metadata ADD COLUMN invoice_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'draft' 
    CHECK (invoice_status IN ('draft', 'sent', 'paid', 'partially_paid', 'overdue', 'cancelled'));

-- Migration 2: Add due date column  
ALTER TABLE invoice_metadata ADD COLUMN due_date DATE;

-- Migration 3: Add payment tracking columns
ALTER TABLE invoice_metadata ADD COLUMN amount_paid DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE invoice_metadata ADD COLUMN amount_outstanding DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE invoice_metadata ADD COLUMN last_payment_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
```

#### `customers` (Remove outstanding_amount)
```sql
-- Use Supabase MCP to apply this migration
-- Remove the problematic field
ALTER TABLE customers DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS outstanding_amount;
-- Keep opening_balance for historical amounts
-- opening_balance remains as-is for pre-system debt
```

#### `payments` (Enhanced)
```sql
-- Use Supabase MCP to apply these migrations individually
-- Migration 1: Add invoice reference
ALTER TABLE payments ADD COLUMN primary_invoice_id UUID REFERENCES invoice_metadata(id);

-- Migration 2: Add allocation tracking
ALTER TABLE payments ADD COLUMN allocation_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'unapplied'
    CHECK (allocation_status IN ('unapplied', 'partially_applied', 'fully_applied'));
ALTER TABLE payments ADD COLUMN amount_applied DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE payments ADD COLUMN amount_unapplied DECIMAL(10,2);

-- Migration 3: Calculate unapplied amount for existing records
UPDATE payments SET amount_unapplied = amount - COALESCE(amount_applied, 0);
```

### 3.3 Database Functions

#### Outstanding Calculation Function
```sql
-- Use Supabase MCP to apply this migration
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_customer_outstanding(customer_uuid UUID)
RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2) AS $$
DECLARE
    outstanding_amount DECIMAL(10,2) := 0;
    opening_balance_amount DECIMAL(10,2) := 0;
    invoice_outstanding DECIMAL(10,2) := 0;
BEGIN
    -- Get opening balance
    SELECT COALESCE(opening_balance, 0) 
    INTO opening_balance_amount
    FROM customers 
    WHERE id = customer_uuid;
    
    -- Get sum of unpaid invoice amounts
    SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount_outstanding), 0)
    INTO invoice_outstanding
    FROM invoice_metadata 
    WHERE customer_id = customer_uuid 
    AND invoice_status NOT IN ('paid', 'cancelled');
    
    outstanding_amount := opening_balance_amount + invoice_outstanding;
    
    RETURN outstanding_amount;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### Invoice Status Update Function
```sql
-- Use Supabase MCP to apply this migration
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_invoice_status(invoice_uuid UUID)
RETURNS VOID AS $$
DECLARE
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2);
    paid_amount DECIMAL(10,2);
    outstanding_amount DECIMAL(10,2);
    new_status VARCHAR(20);
BEGIN
    -- Get invoice total
    SELECT total_amount INTO total_amount 
    FROM invoice_metadata 
    WHERE id = invoice_uuid;
    
    -- Get sum of payments allocated to this invoice
    SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount_allocated), 0) 
    INTO paid_amount
    FROM invoice_payments 
    WHERE invoice_id = invoice_uuid;
    
    outstanding_amount := total_amount - paid_amount;
    
    -- Determine status
    IF outstanding_amount <= 0 THEN
        new_status := 'paid';
    ELSIF paid_amount > 0 THEN
        new_status := 'partially_paid';
    ELSIF (SELECT due_date FROM invoice_metadata WHERE id = invoice_uuid) < CURRENT_DATE THEN
        new_status := 'overdue';
    ELSE
        new_status := 'sent';
    END IF;
    
    -- Update invoice
    UPDATE invoice_metadata 
    SET 
        amount_paid = paid_amount,
        amount_outstanding = outstanding_amount,
        invoice_status = new_status,
        last_payment_date = CASE 
            WHEN paid_amount > 0 THEN (
                SELECT MAX(p.payment_date)
                FROM invoice_payments ip
                JOIN payments p ON ip.payment_id = p.id
                WHERE ip.invoice_id = invoice_uuid
            )
            ELSE NULL
        END
    WHERE id = invoice_uuid;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

```

## 5. Technical Implementation

### 5.1 Server Actions

#### `src/lib/actions/outstanding.ts`
```typescript
"use server"

import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/server"

export async function getCustomerOutstanding(customerId: string) {
  const supabase = await createClient()
  
  // Use Supabase MCP client for more complex queries if needed
  // Get customer with opening balance
  const { data: customer } = await supabase
    .from("customers")
    .select("*, route:routes(*)")
    .eq("id", customerId)
    .single()
  
  // Get unpaid invoices
  const { data: unpaidInvoices } = await supabase
    .from("invoice_metadata")
    .select(`
      *,
      invoice_line_items(*)
    `)
    .eq("customer_id", customerId)
    .not("invoice_status", "in", "('paid', 'cancelled')")
    .order("invoice_date")
  
  // Calculate total outstanding
  const invoiceOutstanding = unpaidInvoices?.reduce(
    (sum, invoice) => sum + (invoice.amount_outstanding || 0), 0
  ) || 0
  
  const totalOutstanding = (customer?.opening_balance || 0) + invoiceOutstanding
  
  return {
    customer,
    unpaidInvoices,
    openingBalance: customer?.opening_balance || 0,
    invoiceOutstanding,
    totalOutstanding
  }
}

export async function getOutstandingDashboard() {
  const supabase = await createClient()
  
  // Use Supabase MCP to call the database function for complex queries
  // Get customers with outstanding amounts using the view we created
  const { data: customersWithOutstanding } = await supabase
    .from("customer_outstanding_summary")
    .select("*")
    .order("total_outstanding", { ascending: false })
  
  // Get overdue invoices count
  const { count: overdueInvoices } = await supabase
    .from("invoice_metadata")
    .select("*", { count: "exact", head: true })
    .lt("due_date", new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0])
    .not("invoice_status", "in", "('paid', 'cancelled')")
  
  const totalOutstanding = customersWithOutstanding?.reduce(
    (sum, customer) => sum + (customer.total_outstanding || 0), 0
  ) || 0
  
  return {
    totalOutstanding,
    customersWithOutstanding: customersWithOutstanding?.length || 0,
    overdueInvoices: overdueInvoices || 0,
    averageOutstanding: customersWithOutstanding?.length 
      ? totalOutstanding / customersWithOutstanding.length 
      : 0
  }
}
```

#### Payment Allocation Action
```typescript
export async function allocatePayment(
  paymentId: string,
  allocations: Array<{
    invoiceId: string
    amount: number
  }>
) {
  const supabase = await createClient()
  
  try {
    // Start transaction - Supabase MCP handles transactions automatically
    const { data: payment } = await supabase
      .from("payments")
      .select("amount")
      .eq("id", paymentId)
      .single()
    
    const totalAllocation = allocations.reduce((sum, alloc) => sum + alloc.amount, 0)
    
    if (totalAllocation > payment.amount) {
      throw new Error("Allocation exceeds payment amount")
    }
    
    // Insert allocations
    for (const allocation of allocations) {
      await supabase
        .from("invoice_payments")
        .insert({
          invoice_id: allocation.invoiceId,
          payment_id: paymentId,
          amount_allocated: allocation.amount
        })
      
      // Update invoice status using the database function we created
      // Use Supabase MCP for calling stored procedures
      await supabase.rpc('update_invoice_status', {
        invoice_uuid: allocation.invoiceId
      })
    }
    
    // Update payment status
    const amountApplied = totalAllocation
    const amountUnapplied = payment.amount - totalAllocation
    
    await supabase
      .from("payments")
      .update({
        amount_applied: amountApplied,
        amount_unapplied: amountUnapplied,
        allocation_status: amountUnapplied > 0 ? 'partially_applied' : 'fully_applied'
      })
      .eq("id", paymentId)
    
    return { success: true }
  } catch (error) {
    throw error
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Database Views for Performance

#### Outstanding Summary View
```sql
-- Use Supabase MCP to apply this migration
CREATE VIEW customer_outstanding_summary AS
SELECT 
    c.id as customer_id,
    c.billing_name,
    c.contact_person,
    r.name as route_name,
    COALESCE(c.opening_balance, 0) as opening_balance,
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE 
        WHEN i.invoice_status NOT IN ('paid', 'cancelled') 
        THEN i.amount_outstanding 
        ELSE 0 
    END), 0) as invoice_outstanding,
    COALESCE(c.opening_balance, 0) + COALESCE(SUM(CASE 
        WHEN i.invoice_status NOT IN ('paid', 'cancelled') 
        THEN i.amount_outstanding 
        ELSE 0 
    END), 0) as total_outstanding,
    COUNT(CASE 
        WHEN i.invoice_status NOT IN ('paid', 'cancelled') 
        THEN 1 
    END) as unpaid_invoice_count,
    MIN(CASE 
        WHEN i.invoice_status NOT IN ('paid', 'cancelled') 
        THEN i.invoice_date 
    END) as oldest_unpaid_date
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN routes r ON c.route_id = r.id
LEFT JOIN invoice_metadata i ON c.id = i.customer_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.billing_name, c.contact_person, r.name, c.opening_balance
HAVING COALESCE(c.opening_balance, 0) + COALESCE(SUM(CASE 
    WHEN i.invoice_status NOT IN ('paid', 'cancelled') 
    THEN i.amount_outstanding 
    ELSE 0 
END), 0) > 0;
```

## 6. Integration Strategy

### 6.1 Dashboard Integration
**Enhanced Main Dashboard** (`/dashboard/page.tsx`):
- Add Outstanding summary card
- Show total outstanding amount across all customers
- Show count of customers with outstanding > 0
- Quick link to Outstanding section

### 6.2 Customer Profile Integration
**Customer Detail Pages** (`/dashboard/customers/[id]/page.tsx`):
- Replace existing outstanding display with invoice-based calculation
- Show breakdown: "₹5,000 outstanding from 3 unpaid invoices"
- Add "View Outstanding Details" link to customer outstanding page
- Quick payment entry with automatic invoice allocation

### 6.3 Invoice Generation Integration
**Invoice Creation Process**:
1. When invoices are generated in `/dashboard/invoices/generate`
2. Create `invoice_line_items` records for each subscription/manual sale
3. Set initial `amount_outstanding = total_amount`
4. Set `invoice_status = 'sent'` and `due_date = invoice_date + 30 days`

### 6.4 Payment System Integration
**Payment Entry** (`/dashboard/payments/new`):
- Add invoice allocation interface
- Auto-suggest invoices for selected customer
- Allow payments without immediate allocation (unapplied payments)
- Provide "Apply to Oldest Invoices First" option

## 7. Migration Strategy

### 7.1 Data Migration Plan

#### Phase 1: Create New Structure
```sql
-- Use Supabase MCP apply_migration command for each of these:
-- 1. Create new tables (invoice_line_items, invoice_payments, unapplied_payments)
-- 2. Add new columns to existing tables (invoice_metadata, customers, payments)
-- 3. Create database functions and views (calculate_customer_outstanding, update_invoice_status, customer_outstanding_summary)
```

#### Phase 2: Migrate Existing Data
```sql
-- Use Supabase MCP to execute these SQL commands for data migration
-- Migration script for existing outstanding amounts
WITH customer_outstanding AS (
  SELECT 
    id,
    COALESCE(outstanding_amount, 0) as current_outstanding,
    COALESCE(opening_balance, 0) as existing_opening_balance
  FROM customers 
  WHERE outstanding_amount > 0
)
UPDATE customers 
SET opening_balance = COALESCE(opening_balance, 0) + COALESCE(outstanding_amount, 0)
WHERE outstanding_amount > 0;

-- Create "migration invoices" for existing outstanding amounts
INSERT INTO invoice_metadata (
  customer_id,
  invoice_number,
  invoice_date,
  due_date,
  total_amount,
  amount_outstanding,
  invoice_status,
  file_path
)
SELECT 
  c.id,
  'MIGRATED-' || c.id::text,
  CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days', -- Backdated
  CURRENT_DATE,
  c.outstanding_amount,
  c.outstanding_amount,
  'sent',
  'system/migration/migrated-outstanding.pdf'
FROM customers c 
WHERE c.outstanding_amount > 0;
```

#### Phase 3: Update Application Code
- Deploy new outstanding calculation logic
- Update all references to use new system
- Remove old outstanding_amount field

### 7.2 Testing Strategy

#### Database Testing
```sql
-- Use Supabase MCP to execute this SQL query for testing outstanding calculation accuracy
SELECT 
  c.billing_name,
  c.opening_balance,
  SUM(i.amount_outstanding) as invoice_outstanding,
  calculate_customer_outstanding(c.id) as calculated_outstanding
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN invoice_metadata i ON c.id = i.customer_id 
  AND i.invoice_status NOT IN ('paid', 'cancelled')
GROUP BY c.id, c.billing_name, c.opening_balance;
```

#### Application Testing
1. **Outstanding Dashboard**: Verify summary calculations
2. **Customer Outstanding**: Test detail page accuracy
3. **Payment Allocation**: Test allocation logic with various scenarios
4. **Invoice Status Updates**: Verify automatic status changes

## 11. Supabase MCP Integration Guide

### 11.1 Using Supabase MCP for Database Operations

#### Available MCP Commands
- `mcp__supabase__apply_migration` - Apply DDL operations (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, etc.)
- `mcp__supabase__execute_sql` - Execute raw SQL queries for data operations
- `mcp__supabase__list_tables` - List all tables in the database
- `mcp__supabase__get_advisors` - Check for security and performance issues

#### Migration Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Create New Tables**
```typescript
// Use mcp__supabase__apply_migration for each table creation:
// 1. invoice_line_items table
// 2. invoice_payments table  
// 3. unapplied_payments table
```

**Step 2: Enhance Existing Tables**
```typescript
// Use mcp__supabase__apply_migration for each ALTER TABLE:
// 1. Add columns to invoice_metadata
// 2. Add columns to payments
// 3. Drop outstanding_amount from customers
```

**Step 3: Create Database Functions**
```typescript
// Use mcp__supabase__apply_migration for each function:
// 1. calculate_customer_outstanding function
// 2. update_invoice_status function
```

**Step 4: Create Performance Views**
```typescript
// Use mcp__supabase__apply_migration:
// 1. customer_outstanding_summary view
```

**Step 5: Data Migration**
```typescript
// Use mcp__supabase__execute_sql for data operations:
// 1. Migrate existing outstanding amounts to opening balance
// 2. Create migration invoices for existing outstanding
```

### 11.2 Server Actions Integration

#### Enhanced Outstanding Actions with MCP
```typescript
// In src/lib/actions/outstanding.ts
// Use regular Supabase client for standard queries
// Use MCP commands for complex operations when needed

export async function calculateAllOutstanding() {
  // Could use MCP to execute complex calculations across all customers
  // For batch operations or complex reporting
}

export async function migrateOutstandingData() {
  // Use MCP execute_sql for data migration operations
  // When direct SQL is more efficient than multiple API calls
}
```

### 11.3 Testing with MCP

#### Database Validation
```typescript
// Use mcp__supabase__execute_sql for testing queries:
// 1. Validate outstanding calculations
// 2. Check data integrity after migration
// 3. Performance testing of new views and functions
```

#### Security Checks
```typescript
// Use mcp__supabase__get_advisors regularly:
// 1. After creating new tables (check RLS policies)
// 2. After adding new columns (security review)
// 3. Before production deployment (final security audit)
```

### 11.4 Implementation Best Practices

#### Migration Approach
1. **Use apply_migration for schema changes** - Ensures proper versioning and rollback capability
2. **Use execute_sql for data operations** - Direct SQL for complex data transformations
3. **Test each migration step** - Validate before proceeding to next step
4. **Check advisors after changes** - Ensure security compliance

#### Error Handling
```typescript
// Example of proper MCP error handling in server actions
try {
  await applyMigration('create_invoice_line_items', createTableSQL)
  await executeSql(dataMigrationSQL)
} catch (error) {
  // Log error and handle gracefully
  console.error('Migration failed:', error)
  throw new Error('Outstanding system migration failed')
}
```

This comprehensive plan provides a complete roadmap for implementing a proper invoice-based outstanding system that accurately reflects business reality and provides clear audit trails for all financial transactions. The integration with Supabase MCP ensures efficient database operations and proper migration management.
