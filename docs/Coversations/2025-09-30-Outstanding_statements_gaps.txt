What are the calculations for the all the columns in these reports please explain in details. Find the gaps for me and tell me the fixes needed in simple language. DOnt make changes. 
We will discuss on these. Keep the start and end dates in mind and also what should be the desired value for that date. You can use supabase mcp for analysis of few examples after you
 are done with code analysis. 

● I'll analyze the calculations for all columns in the outstanding reports. Let me read the key files to understand the logic.

● Based on my comprehensive code analysis, let me explain all column calculations and identify the gaps:

  OUTSTANDING REPORT CALCULATIONS - DETAILED BREAKDOWN

  Report Configuration

  - Start Date: Used as "Opening Balance Date" - the point-in-time snapshot
  - End Date: Used as "Outstanding Calculation Date" - transactions up to this date

  ---
  COLUMN-BY-COLUMN CALCULATIONS

  1. OPENING BALANCE (as of Start Date)

  Current Calculation:
  Original Opening Balance - Total Opening Balance Payments Ever Made

  Source:
  - customers.opening_balance (immutable field)
  - Minus: ALL payments in opening_balance_payments table (no date filter)

  ❌ GAP #1: Opening Balance Ignores Start Date
  - Problem: Opening balance payments are summed for ALL TIME, not filtered by start_date
  - What happens: If you allocated ₹500 to opening balance on Oct 15th, but run report for Sept 1-30, that ₹500 still reduces the September opening balance
  - Example:
    - Customer has ₹1000 opening balance
    - On Oct 15: Payment of ₹500 allocated to opening balance
    - Report for Sept 1-30 shows: ₹1000 - ₹500 = ₹500 ❌
    - Should show: ₹1000 (because Oct 15 payment is AFTER September)

  Fix Needed:
  -- Current (WRONG):
  c.opening_balance - COALESCE(SUM(obp.amount), 0)

  -- Should be (CORRECT):
  c.opening_balance - COALESCE(SUM(obp.amount) FILTER (WHERE obp.created_at < start_date), 0)

  ---
  2. SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT (between Start Date and End Date)

  Current Calculation:
  SUM of all subscription line items where invoice_date month is between start_date month and end_date month

  Source: customer_subscription_breakdown view
  date_trunc('month', im.invoice_date) -- Uses invoice_date, not delivery date!

  ❌ GAP #2: Uses Invoice Date Instead of Delivery/Order Date
  - Problem: Subscriptions are grouped by invoice month, not delivery month
  - What happens: If you generate invoice on Sept 30 for October deliveries, those October deliveries appear in September report
  - Example:
    - Daily orders delivered: Oct 1-31 (31 days × 2L = 62L milk)
    - Invoice generated: Sept 30 for October period
    - Report Sept 1-30 shows: 62L milk ❌
    - Should show: 0L (no deliveries in September)

  Real-World Impact:
  - If you invoice in advance (common practice), deliveries appear in wrong month
  - Cross-month invoicing causes double-counting or missing amounts

  Fix Needed:
  -- Current view uses:
  GROUP BY date_trunc('month', im.invoice_date)

  -- Should use:
  GROUP BY date_trunc('month', daily_orders.order_date)
  -- Filter: WHERE daily_orders.order_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date

  ---
  3. MANUAL SALES AMOUNT (between Start Date and End Date)

  Current Calculation:
  SUM of credit sales where sale_date is between start_date and end_date

  Source: customer_sales_breakdown view
  WHERE s.sale_date >= startDate AND s.sale_date <= endDate

  ✅ CORRECT - This calculation appears accurate

  Note: Only includes:
  - sale_type = 'Credit' (Cash/QR sales excluded correctly)
  - payment_status = 'Pending' via invoice line items

  ---
  4. PAYMENTS AMOUNT (between Start Date and End Date)

  Current Calculation:
  SUM of all payments where payment_date is between start_date and end_date

  Source: customer_payment_breakdown view
  WHERE p.payment_date >= startDate AND p.payment_date < (endDate + 1 day)

  ❌ GAP #3: Includes ALL Payments Regardless of Allocation Type
  - Problem: All payments are counted, even those allocated to opening balance or direct sales
  - What happens: Payment allocated to opening balance gets counted twice:
    a. Reduces opening balance (eventually)
    b. Also counted in "Payments" column
  - Example:
    - Opening Balance: ₹1000
    - Payment ₹500 on Sept 15 → allocated to opening balance
    - Report Sept 1-30 shows:
        - Opening Balance: ₹1000 - ₹500 = ₹500 (GAP #1 makes this wrong too)
      - Payments: -₹500
      - Net effect: ₹500 - ₹500 = ₹0 but customer still owes subscriptions/sales!

  Conceptual Issue:
  The report mixes:
  - Point-in-time balance (opening balance)
  - Period transactions (subscriptions, sales, payments)

  Fix Needed:
  Payment types should be separated or clarified:
  - Payments toward invoices (subscriptions + sales already invoiced)
  - Payments toward opening balance (historical debt)
  - Payments toward direct sales (bypassing invoices)

  ---
  5. GROSS OUTSTANDING (calculated field)

  Current Calculation:
  Opening Balance + Subscription Amount + Manual Sales Amount - Payments Amount

  Actual Implementation:
  From outstanding_report_data view:
  (effective_opening_balance + invoice_outstanding) as total_outstanding

  Where:
  - effective_opening_balance = opening_balance - opening_balance_payments
  - invoice_outstanding = SUM(total_amount - amount_paid) from unpaid invoices

  ❌ GAP #4: Mismatch Between Display and Database Calculation
  - Problem: The UI shows "Opening + Subs + Sales - Payments" but database calculates "Effective Opening + Invoice Outstanding"
  - These are NOT the same thing!

  Why they differ:
  1. Invoices might not exist yet for all deliveries in the period
  2. Invoice outstanding = Net invoice amount - allocated payments (different from period payments)
  3. Opening balance payments reduces opening balance but isn't shown in "Payments" column

  Example Scenario:
  - Period: Sept 1-30
  - Subscriptions delivered: ₹1000 worth in September
  - Invoice generated: Oct 5 for September deliveries
  - Report on Sept 30 (before invoice):
    - UI shows: Subscription Amount = ₹1000
    - DB calculates: Invoice Outstanding = ₹0 (invoice doesn't exist yet)
    - Mismatch!

  ---
  6. CREDITS AVAILABLE (Unapplied Payments) - NO DATE FILTER

  Current Calculation:
  SUM of amount_unapplied from unapplied_payments view (ALL TIME)

  Source: unapplied_payments view
  -- No date filtering whatsoever
  SELECT customer_id, amount_unapplied FROM unapplied_payments

  ⚠️ GAP #5: No Date Filtering on Credits
  - Problem: Shows ALL unapplied payments regardless of when they were made
  - What happens: Payment made in November shows as credit in September report
  - Is this correct? DEBATABLE
    - Current behavior: Shows current credit available (point-in-time snapshot at report generation)
    - Alternative: Show only credits available as of end_date

  Example:
  - Report period: Sept 1-30
  - Payment ₹2000 made on Nov 15 (not allocated)
  - Report shows: Credits Available = ₹2000
  - Question: Should Nov 15 payment appear in September report?
    - Current: YES (shows current account status)
    - Alternative: NO (historically accurate for Sept 30)

  This might be intentional - showing current credit status to help with collection decisions.

  ---
  7. NET BALANCE (calculated field)

  Current Calculation:
  Gross Outstanding - Credits Available

  Code:
  const netBalance = total_outstanding - (unapplied_payments_amount || 0)

  Result Display:
  - If positive: Shows as red outstanding amount
  - If negative: Shows as green "Cr. ₹X.XX"
  - If zero: Shows "₹0.00"

  ✅ CORRECT - This calculation is straightforward

  ---
  SUMMARY OF GAPS

  🔴 CRITICAL GAPS:

  1. Opening Balance Ignores Report Start Date
    - Payments allocated to opening balance after end_date still reduce it
    - Makes historical reports incorrect
  2. Subscriptions Use Invoice Date Instead of Delivery Date
    - Cross-month invoicing causes wrong period allocation
    - Advance invoicing shows future deliveries in current period
  3. Gross Outstanding Formula Mismatch
    - UI calculation: Opening + Subs + Sales - Payments
    - DB calculation: Effective Opening + Invoice Outstanding
    - These are fundamentally different and cause confusion

  ⚠️ DESIGN QUESTIONS:

  4. Payment Allocation Type Not Distinguished
    - All payments counted in "Payments" column regardless of what they paid
    - Opening balance payments create double-counting effect
    - Need to clarify: Does "Payments" mean "payments toward period transactions" or "all payments made in period"?
  5. Credits Available Shows Current Status, Not Historical
    - Unapplied payments from future dates appear in past reports
    - Is this intentional? (Probably yes for decision-making)

  ---
  RECOMMENDED FIXES (Simple Language)

  Fix #1: Filter Opening Balance Payments by Date

  Only subtract opening balance payments that happened BEFORE the report start date.

  Fix #2: Use Delivery Date for Subscriptions

  Group subscriptions by the actual delivery/order date, not the invoice date.

  Fix #3: Clarify Payment Types

  Either:
  - Option A: Show only invoice payments in "Payments" column (exclude opening balance payments)
  - Option B: Add separate column for "Opening Balance Payments"

  Fix #4: Choose One Calculation Method

  Either:
  - Show period transactions (Subs + Sales - Payments) - simpler, matches UI
  - Show invoice-based outstanding (current DB method) - more accurate for unpaid invoices
  - Don't mix both!

  Fix #5: Document Credit Behavior

  Add tooltip explaining: "Shows current credit balance available, not historical balance at report end date"
