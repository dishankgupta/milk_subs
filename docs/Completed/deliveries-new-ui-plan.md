interface DeliveryWithAdditionalItemsFormData extends DeliveryFormData {
  additional_items?: AdditionalItemFormData[]
}

interface AdditionalItemFormData {
  product_id: string
  quantity: number
  unit_price: number
  total_amount: number
  notes?: string
}

// Bulk operations with additional items
interface BulkDeliveryWithAdditionalItemsFormData {
  deliveries: DeliveryFormData[]
  additional_items_by_customer?: Array<{
    customer_id: string
    items: AdditionalItemFormData[]
  }>
}
```

- **Form Stability**: Memoized default values to prevent React Hook Form re-initialization

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/dashboard/deliveries/bulk/bulk-delivery-form.tsx` - Major simplification and radio button implementation
- `src/components/deliveries/bulk-additional-items-manager.tsx` - Component removed
- `src/lib/types.ts` - Cleaned up unused interfaces for additional items in bulk operations

### **Business Impact Assessment**

**Positive Outcomes:**
- ‚úÖ **Reliability**: No more React errors with large delivery batches
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Faster rendering and form interactions
- ‚úÖ **User Experience**: Cleaner, more intuitive radio button interface
