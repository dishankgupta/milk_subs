# Outstanding System Rework - Summary of Changes

## Overview

On August 20, 2025, we completed a comprehensive rework of the outstanding calculation system to fix fundamental issues and implement proper invoice-based tracking.

## Key Problems Solved

### Before (Problematic System)
- `customers.outstanding_amount` field was disconnected from invoices
- Outstanding amounts existed without corresponding invoices
- No payment-to-invoice allocation tracking
- No audit trail for outstanding calculations
- Customer couldn't see which specific invoices were unpaid

### After (Fixed System)
- Outstanding = Sum of unpaid invoices + opening balance
- All outstanding amounts traceable to specific invoices
- Complete payment allocation system
- Full audit trail from invoice → payment → outstanding
- Clear customer statements showing invoice breakdown

## Database Changes

### New Tables Added
1. **`invoice_line_items`** - Detailed line items for each invoice
2. **`invoice_payments`** - Payment allocation tracking
3. **`unapplied_payments`** - Payments not yet allocated to invoices

### Tables Enhanced
1. **`invoice_metadata`** - Added status tracking and payment tracking columns
2. **`payments`** - Added allocation status and tracking columns
3. **`customers`** - Removed problematic `outstanding_amount` field

### Database Functions Added
1. **`calculate_customer_outstanding()`** - Proper outstanding calculation
2. **`update_invoice_status()`** - Automatic invoice status updates
3. **`customer_outstanding_summary`** - Performance view for dashboards
