# Dairy Subscription Manager - Development Journal

## August 5, 2025 - Project Initialization
**Time:** 20:00 IST
**Goals:** Set up Next.js project, configure Supabase, basic project structure

**What I accomplished:**
- Initialized Next.js 15 project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, and Turbopack
- Configured package.json with essential dependencies:
  - Supabase client libraries (@supabase/ssr, @supabase/supabase-js)
  - Radix UI components for accessible UI (@radix-ui/react-dialog, @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu)
  - Utility libraries (clsx, tailwind-merge, class-variance-authority, lucide-react)
- Set up project structure following Next.js App Router pattern
- Created CLAUDE.md for future development guidance
- Analyzed comprehensive project requirements document (273 lines of detailed specifications)
- Established development environment with pnpm as package manager

**Challenges faced:**
- None yet - smooth initial setup with create-next-app

**Key learnings:**
- Project is a comprehensive dairy subscription management system replacing Excel tracking
- Key business context: A2 Cow Milk + Buffalo Milk delivery, 2 routes, morning/evening schedules
- Core features needed: customer management, subscription patterns, daily order generation, delivery tracking, payment management
- Technology stack aligned: Next.js + Supabase + Tailwind + TypeScript as specified in requirements

**Next session goals:**
- Phase 1 implementation: Database schema creation in Supabase
- Set up authentication system
- Create basic UI framework with sidebar navigation
- Implement customer management foundation
- Start core table structures (customers, products, routes, base_subscriptions)

## August 5, 2025 - Planning & Requirements Refinement
**Time:** 20:30 IST
**Goals:** Clarify business requirements and finalize Phase 1 implementation details

**What I accomplished:**
- Conducted detailed requirements clarification session with business owner
- Refined customer data structure: billing_name (primary) vs contact_person distinction
- Established phone number requirements: up to 3 numbers per customer (1 primary)
- Clarified subscription patterns: maximum 2-day cycles only (simplified from original 3-day/weekly)
- Confirmed product pricing: ₹75/L for CM, ₹80/L for BM with INR formatting
- Defined customer status: Active/Inactive only (removed "Stopped" complexity)
- Established data migration approach: one-time manual CSV upload vs automated import system
- Updated authentication scope: admin-only access for Phase 1
- Removed same-day modification requirement (next-day only)

**Key business clarifications:**
- Billing name vs contact person: Some customers bill under different names than delivery contact
- Pattern examples: Day 1: 1L BM → Day 2: 2L BM → repeat (2-day cycle maximum)
- Outstanding payment tracking: Required for existing customer data
- Phone numbers: Primary contact plus up to 2 additional numbers per customer

**Technical decisions:**
- Manual CSV data upload approach (no automated import UI needed initially)
- Indian Rupee currency formatting throughout application
- Simplified customer status management
- Focus on core functionality over complex data import features

**Updated requirements document:**
- Added billing_name/contact_person clarification
- Updated pricing with specific INR amounts
- Simplified pattern cycles to 2-day maximum
- Removed same-day modification complexity
- Added multiple phone number support

**Next session goals:**
- Create refined database schema in Supabase with new structure
- Set up Supabase authentication (admin-only)
- Build basic UI framework with sidebar navigation
- Implement customer management with billing_name/contact_person fields
- Prepare for manual CSV data upload when provided
- Focus on 2-day pattern subscription logic
