## Database Migration Strategy

### Step 1: Backup Current Database
```sql
-- Create full database backup before migration
pg_dump -h your_supabase_host -U postgres -d postgres > backup_pre_sales_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

### Step 2: Schema Validation
The following tables should already exist (Phase 5.1-5.4 complete):
- ✅ `products` (with GST fields)
- ✅ `customers` (with opening_balance field)  
- ✅ `sales` (complete table)
- ✅ `invoice_metadata` (complete table)

### Step 3: Data Migration Scripts

**A. Opening Balance Import**
```bash
# Place your opening balance CSV file in scripts/migration/
node scripts/migration/import-opening-balances.js opening-balances.csv
```

**Expected CSV format:**
```csv
customer_name,billing_name,opening_balance,notes
Abdul Rehman,Abdul Rehman,500.00,Historical outstanding from June 2024
Abhishek Mali,Abhishek Mali,750.00,Previous month balance
```

**B. Historical Sales Import (if needed)**
Create sales records for historical data using the sales API endpoints or direct database inserts.

## Environment Configuration

### Production Environment Variables
```bash
# .env.production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_production_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_production_service_key

# Invoice file storage (ensure directories exist)
INVOICE_STORAGE_PATH=/app/storage/invoices
INVOICE_BACKUP_PATH=/app/backups/invoices

# Performance settings
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production
```

### File System Setup
```bash
# Create required directories
mkdir -p /app/storage/invoices
mkdir -p /app/backups/invoices
mkdir -p /app/logs

# Set proper permissions
chmod 755 /app/storage/invoices
chmod 755 /app/backups/invoices
```

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Application Deployment
```bash
# Build production version
pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start

# Or deploy to your hosting platform (Vercel, Railway, etc.)
```

### 2. Database Verification
```sql
-- Verify all tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check data integrity
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers) as customers,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products WHERE is_subscription_product = false) as manual_products,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales) as sales,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoice_metadata) as invoices;
```

### 3. Feature Testing Checklist
After deployment, test these workflows:

**Sales Management:**
- [ ] Create cash sale (no customer required)
- [ ] Create credit sale (customer required, updates outstanding)
- [ ] Edit existing sales
- [ ] Search and filter sales history

**Invoice Generation:**
- [ ] Generate individual customer invoice
- [ ] Test bulk invoice generation
- [ ] Verify PDF file creation and storage
- [ ] Check invoice numbering sequence

**Outstanding Reports:**
- [ ] Generate outstanding amounts report
- [ ] Test expandable levels (Customer → Transaction Type → Details)
- [ ] Verify print functionality (Summary, Statements, Complete)
- [ ] Check opening balance + current outstanding calculations

**Integration Features:**
- [ ] Customer detail page shows sales history
- [ ] Enhanced outstanding display (opening + current)
- [ ] Navigation menus include Sales and Invoices sections
- [ ] Dashboard shows sales metrics

---

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance Targets
- **Customer List Load:** < 500ms
- **Sales History Query:** < 800ms  
- **Outstanding Report Generation:** < 2 seconds
- **Invoice Data Collection:** < 1 second
- **Bulk Outstanding Calculation:** < 3 seconds

### Monitoring Recommendations
```bash
# Monitor key metrics
- Average response times
- Database query performance
- Invoice generation success rate
- User activity patterns
- Error rates and types
```

---

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies active
- ✅ Admin-only authentication enforced
- ✅ No customer data in client-side code
- ✅ PDF files stored securely with access controls

### Business Logic Security
- ✅ Cash sales cannot have customer assignment
- ✅ Credit sales require customer validation
- ✅ GST calculations server-side only
- ✅ Invoice numbering atomic operations

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**1. Invoice Generation Fails**
```bash
# Check file permissions
ls -la /app/storage/invoices

# Verify PDF generation libraries
npm list puppeteer

# Check invoice sequence integrity
SELECT MAX(invoice_number) FROM invoice_metadata;
```

**2. Outstanding Amounts Incorrect**
```sql
-- Verify outstanding calculation logic
SELECT 
  c.billing_name,
  c.opening_balance,
  c.outstanding_amount,
  COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN s.sale_type = 'Credit' AND s.payment_status = 'Pending' 
                    THEN s.total_amount ELSE 0 END), 0) as calculated_outstanding
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN sales s ON c.id = s.customer_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.billing_name, c.opening_balance, c.outstanding_amount
HAVING c.outstanding_amount != COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN s.sale_type = 'Credit' AND s.payment_status = 'Pending' 
                                                THEN s.total_amount ELSE 0 END), 0);
```

**3. GST Calculations Wrong**
```sql
-- Verify GST calculation accuracy
SELECT 
  s.id,
  s.total_amount,
  s.gst_amount,
  p.gst_rate,
  (s.total_amount / (1 + p.gst_rate/100)) as calculated_base,
  (s.total_amount - (s.total_amount / (1 + p.gst_rate/100))) as calculated_gst
FROM sales s
JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.id
WHERE ABS(s.gst_amount - (s.total_amount - (s.total_amount / (1 + p.gst_rate/100)))) > 0.01;
```

## Backup Strategy

### Daily Backups
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# backup-daily.sh
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)
pg_dump -h your_host -U postgres -d postgres > /app/backups/daily_backup_$DATE.sql
find /app/backups -name "daily_backup_*.sql" -mtime +7 -delete
```

### Invoice File Backups
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# backup-invoices.sh
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)
tar -czf /app/backups/invoices_$DATE.tar.gz /app/storage/invoices/
find /app/backups -name "invoices_*.tar.gz" -mtime +30 -delete
```

---
