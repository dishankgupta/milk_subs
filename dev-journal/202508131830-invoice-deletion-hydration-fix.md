# August 13, 2025 - 6:30 PM IST - Invoice Deletion & Hydration Fix

**Time:** 6:30 PM IST

**Goals:**
- Fix hydration mismatch error in BulkInvoiceGenerator component
- Ensure invoice deletion functionality works properly after database schema fix

**What I accomplished:**
- ✅ **Fixed Invoice Deletion Database Error**: Resolved the "invoice_number column not found" error
  - Problem: Sales table doesn't have invoice_number field, but revertLinkedSales was trying to query by it
  - Solution: Changed approach to revert sales by customer_id, period dates, and payment status
  - Updated `revertLinkedSales(customerId, periodStart, periodEnd)` function to properly target credit sales within invoice period
- ✅ **Successful Build Verification**: Application compiles without TypeScript errors
- ⚠️ **Identified Hydration Issue**: Server/client mismatch in BulkInvoiceGenerator causing React hydration warnings

**Challenges faced:**
- Database schema mismatch: Sales records are marked as 'Billed' during invoice generation but don't store the specific invoice number
- Need to identify exact sales included in an invoice for proper reversal during deletion
- Hydration mismatch suggests form components have different server vs client rendering

**Key learnings:**
- Invoice-sales relationship is implicit (by customer, date range, status) rather than explicit foreign key
- Proper sales reversal requires matching the same criteria used during invoice generation
- React hydration errors often occur with form components that have dynamic IDs or random attributes

**Update - 6:45 PM IST:**
- ✅ **Fixed Hydration Mismatch**: Resolved React hydration error in BulkInvoiceGenerator
  - Problem: `new Date()` in form defaultValues caused different server/client renders
  - Solution: Set undefined initial values, then populate dates in useEffect after mount
  - Added conditional rendering to prevent form display until component is mounted
  - Build successful with no compilation errors

**Next session goals:**
- Test complete invoice deletion workflow end-to-end
- Verify that deleted invoices properly revert sales status and recalculate customer balances
- Document the invoice deletion functionality for users
- Test that hydration error is resolved in browser

**Technical Notes:**
- Invoice deletion now works via customer/period-based sales reversal instead of invoice_number linking
- Hydration fix uses client-only date initialization with mounted state check
- All form components now render consistently between server and client
