# Development Journal Entry

## August 5, 2025 - Project Initialization
**Time:** 18:00 IST
**Goals:** Set up Next.js project, configure Supabase, basic project structure

**What I accomplished:**
- Initialized Next.js 15 project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, and Turbopack
- Configured package.json with essential dependencies:
  - Supabase client libraries (@supabase/ssr, @supabase/supabase-js)
  - Radix UI components for accessible UI (@radix-ui/react-dialog, @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu)
  - Utility libraries (clsx, tailwind-merge, class-variance-authority, lucide-react)
- Set up project structure following Next.js App Router pattern
- Created CLAUDE.md for future development guidance
- Analyzed comprehensive project requirements document (273 lines of detailed specifications)
- Established development environment with pnpm as package manager

**Challenges faced:**
- None yet - smooth initial setup with create-next-app

**Key learnings:**
- Project is a comprehensive dairy subscription management system replacing Excel tracking
- Key business context: A2 Cow Milk + Buffalo Milk delivery, 2 routes, morning/evening schedules
- Core features needed: customer management, subscription patterns, daily order generation, delivery tracking, payment management
- Technology stack aligned: Next.js + Supabase + Tailwind + TypeScript as specified in requirements

**Next session goals:**
- Phase 1 implementation: Database schema creation in Supabase
- Set up authentication system
- Create basic UI framework with sidebar navigation
- Implement customer management foundation
- Start core table structures (customers, products, routes, base_subscriptions)
