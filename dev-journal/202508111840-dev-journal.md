# August 11, 2025 - Print Layout Sorting Fix

**Time:** 6:40 PM IST

**Goals:**
- Fix print layout for delivery reports to respect page sorting

**What I accomplished:**
- Modified `/api/print/route-delivery/route.ts` to accept `sort_key` and `sort_direction` parameters
- Added sorting logic to API route that mirrors the page sorting functionality
- Updated delivery reports interface print handler to pass current sort configuration to print API
- Implemented sorting for all 4 sortable columns: customerName, productName, quantity, totalAmount
- Ensured print layout displays orders in exact same order as page

**Challenges faced:**
- Print API route was completely separate from page sorting logic
- Needed to pass sorting state from client to server-side print generation
- Had to implement consistent sorting algorithm in API route

**Key learnings:**
- Print layouts need to maintain consistency with page state
- URL parameters are effective way to pass sorting state to print APIs
- Server-side sorting logic should mirror client-side sorting for consistency

**Next session goals:**
- Monitor for any additional print layout consistency issues
- Continue with remaining Phase 4 mobile optimization tasks
