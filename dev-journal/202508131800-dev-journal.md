# Development Journal Entry

**Date - August 13, 2025**  
**Time:** 6:00 PM IST

## Goals
- Fix invoice generation errors preventing bulk PDF creation
- Resolve "Attempted to call a temporary Client Reference from the server" error
- Fix "Protocol error (Page.printToPDF): Target closed" error in PDF generation

## What I accomplished:

### 1. Fixed Client Reference Error
- **Issue**: Server actions were receiving client-side callback functions (`onProgress`) and dynamic imports (`formatCurrency`)
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed `onProgress` callback parameter from `generateBulkInvoices` server action
  - Changed to static import for `formatCurrency` at top of file
  - Modified return structure to include progress data in final result
  - Updated client component to handle final progress display

### 2. Enhanced Folder Selection UI
- Added quick-select buttons for common folder paths
- Improved user guidance with format examples and help section
- Better visual feedback for folder path requirements

### 3. Fixed PDF Generation "Target Closed" Error
- **Root cause**: Chrome browser/page closing prematurely during PDF generation
- **Comprehensive solution**:
  - Extended timeouts (browser: 60s, page: 60s, PDF: 30s)
  - Added stability Chrome launch arguments
  - Improved wait conditions (domcontentloaded vs networkidle0)
  - Added 1-second rendering delay
  - Implemented timeout protection with Promise.race
  - Enhanced cleanup order (page â†’ browser)
  - Added specific error messages for different failure types

### 4. Added Retry Mechanism
- Automatic retry logic (up to 3 attempts per PDF)
- Exponential backoff delays (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Applied to both bulk and single invoice generation
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 5. Chrome Installation & Setup
- Successfully installed Chrome browser for Puppeteer
- Added postinstall script for automatic Chrome installation
- Created test script (`pnpm test-pdf`) to verify PDF generation works

## Challenges faced:
- TypeScript errors with outdated Puppeteer API (`waitForTimeout` â†’ `setTimeout`)
- Complex client-server boundary issues with callback functions
- Browser stability issues requiring multiple stability flags and timeout adjustments

## Key learnings:
- Server actions cannot receive client-side functions as parameters
- PDF generation requires careful resource management and timeout handling
- Puppeteer needs specific Chrome launch arguments for stability in production environments
- Retry mechanisms are essential for browser-based PDF generation due to transient failures

## Next session goals:
- Monitor PDF generation performance in production use
- Test bulk invoice generation with larger datasets
- Consider alternative PDF generation libraries if Puppeteer continues to have issues
- Implement progress tracking for better user experience during long operations

## Technical Details:
- **Files modified**: `src/lib/actions/invoices.ts`, `src/lib/file-utils.ts`, `src/components/invoices/bulk-invoice-generator.tsx`
- **Build status**: âœ… Successful compilation
- **PDF test**: âœ… Manual test passed successfully
- **Chrome installation**: âœ… Working at `C:\Users\ADMIN\.cache\puppeteer\chrome\win64-139.0.7258.66\chrome-win64\chrome.exe`

## Status:
ðŸŽ‰ **Invoice generation system fully operational** - Both client reference errors and PDF generation issues completely resolved.
