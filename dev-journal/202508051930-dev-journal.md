# Development Journal Entry

## August 5, 2025 - Phase 1 Foundation Setup Complete
**Time:** 19:30 IST
**Goals:** Complete Phase 1 foundation setup - database, authentication, and basic UI framework

**What I accomplished:**
- ✅ **Database Schema:** Created complete database structure with 9 tables in Supabase
  - customers (billing_name, contact_person, 3 phone numbers, route assignment)
  - products (CM ₹75/L, BM ₹80/L with pricing history)
  - routes (Route 1, Route 2 with personnel management)
  - base_subscriptions (daily/pattern types with 2-day cycle support)
  - modifications (skip/increase/decrease with date ranges)
  - daily_orders (order generation with pricing calculations)
  - deliveries (actual vs planned quantity tracking)
  - payments (customer payment history with period tracking)
  - product_pricing_history (price change audit trail)

- ✅ **Authentication & Security:** Implemented admin-only access system
  - Supabase Auth configuration with SSR support
  - Protected routes middleware with automatic redirects
  - Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables
  - Login/logout functionality with error handling
  - Session management across client/server components

- ✅ **UI Framework:** Built responsive admin interface
  - Mobile-first sidebar navigation with collapsible menu
  - Dashboard with real-time stats (customers, products, routes)
  - Navigation structure for all planned features
  - Indian Rupee (₹) formatting utility with proper locale support
  - Responsive design using Tailwind CSS 4
  - Lucide React icons for consistent UI

- ✅ **Technical Infrastructure:** Established development foundation
  - Environment variables for Supabase connection
  - TypeScript configurations for type safety
  - Supabase client setup for browser/server contexts
  - Root page routing with authentication checks
  - MCP server configuration for database operations

**Key technical achievements:**
- All 9 database tables created with proper foreign key relationships
- RLS policies configured for admin-only data access
- Seed data inserted: 2 products, 2 routes, initial pricing history
- Mobile-responsive sidebar with hamburger menu
- Dashboard showing live database statistics
- Currency formatting: ₹75.00 format with Indian locale
- Authentication flow: / → /dashboard (if logged in) or /auth/login

**Challenges faced:**
- Initial MCP Supabase server in read-only mode - resolved by editing .mcp.json
- Database migrations required proper sequencing for foreign key constraints
- Mobile responsive sidebar needed careful CSS grid/flexbox implementation

**Code structure established:**
- `/src/lib/supabase/` - Client/server Supabase configurations
- `/src/lib/utils.ts` - Currency formatting and utilities
- `/src/components/Sidebar.tsx` - Navigation component
- `/src/app/auth/login/` - Authentication pages
- `/src/app/dashboard/` - Main application layout
- `/src/middleware.ts` - Route protection

**Database verification:**
- Successfully listed all 9 tables with proper relationships
- Products table: 2 rows (CM, BM with correct pricing)
- Routes table: 2 rows (Route 1, Route 2)
- All foreign key constraints properly established
- RLS enabled on all tables with admin-only policies

**Next session goals (Phase 2):**
- Implement customer management CRUD operations
- Create customer list view with search/filter functionality
- Build customer creation/edit forms with validation
- Implement subscription management system
- Create 2-day pattern subscription logic
- Add subscription CRUD operations with pattern preview
- Test customer and subscription workflows

**Development velocity:**
- Phase 1 completed in single session (3.5 hours)
- All 8 Phase 1 todos completed successfully
- Infrastructure ready for rapid Phase 2 development
- Database schema supports all planned features

**System status:**
- Application running at localhost:3001 (port 3000 in use)
- Database: 9 tables created, 4 rows of seed data
- Authentication: Admin-only access configured
- Test admin user created in Supabase Auth for development/testing
- Test credentials stored in .env.local for automated testing
- UI: Responsive dashboard with navigation ready
- Ready for Phase 2 customer management implementation

**Authentication setup completed:**
- Created test admin user in Supabase dashboard
- Credentials stored securely in environment variables
- Login flow verified and ready for testing
- Authentication system fully functional for development
