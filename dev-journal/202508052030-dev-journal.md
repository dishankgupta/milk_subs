# Development Journal Entry

## August 5, 2025 - Planning & Requirements Refinement
**Time:** 20:30 IST
**Goals:** Clarify business requirements and finalize Phase 1 implementation details

**What I accomplished:**
- Conducted detailed requirements clarification session with business owner
- Refined customer data structure: billing_name (primary) vs contact_person distinction
- Established phone number requirements: up to 3 numbers per customer (1 primary)
- Clarified subscription patterns: maximum 2-day cycles only (simplified from original 3-day/weekly)
- Confirmed product pricing: ₹75/L for CM, ₹80/L for BM with INR formatting
- Defined customer status: Active/Inactive only (removed "Stopped" complexity)
- Established data migration approach: one-time manual CSV upload vs automated import system
- Updated authentication scope: admin-only access for Phase 1
- Removed same-day modification requirement (next-day only)

**Key business clarifications:**
- Billing name vs contact person: Some customers bill under different names than delivery contact
- Pattern examples: Day 1: 1L BM → Day 2: 2L BM → repeat (2-day cycle maximum)
- Outstanding payment tracking: Required for existing customer data
- Phone numbers: Primary contact plus up to 2 additional numbers per customer

**Technical decisions:**
- Manual CSV data upload approach (no automated import UI needed initially)
- Indian Rupee currency formatting throughout application
- Simplified customer status management
- Focus on core functionality over complex data import features

**Updated requirements document:**
- Added billing_name/contact_person clarification
- Updated pricing with specific INR amounts
- Simplified pattern cycles to 2-day maximum
- Removed same-day modification complexity
- Added multiple phone number support

**Next session goals:**
- Create refined database schema in Supabase with new structure
- Set up Supabase authentication (admin-only)
- Build basic UI framework with sidebar navigation
- Implement customer management with billing_name/contact_person fields
- Prepare for manual CSV data upload when provided
- Focus on 2-day pattern subscription logic
