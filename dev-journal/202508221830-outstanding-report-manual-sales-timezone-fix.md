# August 22, 2025 - Outstanding Report Manual Sales Timezone Fix

**Time**: 6:30 PM IST

**Goals**:
- Resolve manual sales not displaying in Outstanding Report despite having data
- Fix recurring timezone-related date conversion issues
- Eliminate hydration errors in outstanding report form

**What I accomplished:**

### 1. Root Cause Analysis
- Identified manual sales display issue for Abhishek Mundhra (₹75.00 Cow Ghee sale on 22/08/2025)
- Discovered timezone conversion discrepancy between frontend and backend date handling
- Frontend used `formatDateForAPI()` (local date components) vs Backend used `toISOString().split('T')[0]` (UTC conversion)
- Debug logs revealed: selecting 22/08/2025 resulted in backend query with endDate: '2025-08-21'

### 2. Database Investigation
- Verified invoice line item exists for sale ID: `d053bf4b-4944-48f6-bb6f-05ed38eeeba5`
- Confirmed `customer_sales_breakdown` view contains correct data
- All database views and functions working properly
- Issue was purely in date conversion logic

### 3. Technical Fixes Applied

#### Date Conversion Consistency
- **File**: `src/lib/actions/outstanding-reports.ts`
- **Change**: Replaced `toISOString().split('T')[0]` with `formatDateForAPI()` 
- **Impact**: Ensures consistent local date handling between frontend and backend

#### Hydration Error Resolution
- **File**: `src/components/reports/outstanding-report.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed dynamic `useEffect` date setting, used stable default dates
- **Impact**: Eliminated server/client mismatch in form initialization

#### Debug Logging Implementation
- Added comprehensive console logging to track date processing
- Verified query execution and data retrieval during debugging

### 4. Validation Results
- Manual sales now display correctly in Outstanding Report
- Date range selection works as expected (22/08 includes transactions from 22/08)
- Hydration errors resolved
- Test case verified: Abhishek Mundhra's ₹75.00 manual sale appears properly

**Challenges faced:**
- Initial assumption was missing invoice line items, but data was present
- Timezone conversion issues are subtle and hard to detect without debug logging
- Required systematic debugging through multiple layers (database view → backend logic → frontend display)

**Key learnings:**
- Always use consistent date formatting functions across frontend/backend
- `toISOString()` should be avoided for date-only operations due to timezone conversion
- Debug logging is essential for diagnosing date/time related issues
- Hydration errors can resurface when dynamic date logic is reintroduced

**Next session goals:**
- Create Linear issue to document this fix
- Monitor for any other timezone-related issues in the system
- Consider implementing automated tests for date handling edge cases
- Review other components for similar timezone conversion problems

**Technical Notes:**
- Sale created at: 2025-08-22 09:51:10.783276 IST
- Customer ID: 09397c77-edb6-44f7-987f-b244773648c6 (Abhishek Mundhra)
- Invoice ID: ee692475-611c-4bae-8168-28261624d719
- Line Item ID: 045d450c-e425-4774-95dd-287309e5adb7

This fix resolves a critical user experience issue where manual sales transactions were invisible in outstanding reports due to date boundary edge cases.
