# Route-wise Summary Display Fix

**Date - August 7, 2025**
**Time - 11:00 AM**

## Goals
Fix the route-wise summary in order generation preview to display quantities and amounts in the same format as the product summary.

## What I accomplished:
✅ **Fixed route-wise summary display issue**
- Modified `previewDailyOrders` function in `/src/lib/actions/orders.ts` to track route data with quantity and amount (not just order count)
- Changed `byRoute` data structure from `Record<string, number>` to `Record<string, { quantity: number, amount: number }>`
- Updated route tracking to use route names instead of route IDs for better display
- Updated TypeScript interface `PreviewSummary` in `OrderGenerationForm.tsx`
- Modified UI component to display route summary in same format as product summary (quantity in L and amount in ₹)

## Challenges faced:
- Route summary was showing UUID values instead of route names
- Route summary was only showing order counts, not quantities and amounts like product summary
- Required coordinated changes across server action, TypeScript interfaces, and UI component

## Key learnings:
- Order generation preview system has good architecture for extending summary data
- Route data aggregation follows same pattern as product aggregation
- UI consistency important for user experience - both summaries should have same format

## Next session goals:
- Monitor for any other UI inconsistencies or display issues
- Continue with any remaining Phase 4.3 mobile optimization tasks if needed
