  - Value variance tracking with currency formatting
  - Customer delivery patterns and performance metrics
  - Product-wise delivery completion rates and variance analysis
  - Daily trend analysis with historical performance tracking
  - Priority-based performance indicators with badge system

- ✅ **Technical Excellence**: Production-ready implementation
  - TypeScript strict mode compliance with Delivery interface
  - Zod validation schemas for delivery form data
  - Server-side rendering with proper error handling
  - ESLint compliant code with zero warnings
  - Next.js 15 compatibility with async params and searchParams
  - Mobile-responsive design throughout all delivery interfaces
  - Toast notifications for user feedback and error handling

**Key technical achievements:**
- Complete delivery lifecycle from order selection to delivery confirmation
- Automatic variance calculations with real-time visual feedback
- Advanced analytics with customer, product, and daily performance breakdowns

- Comprehensive reporting queries with customer and product performance analysis
- Proper error handling and transaction management throughout

**Challenges overcome:**
- Next.js 15 async params/searchParams compatibility across all delivery pages
- React hooks rules violations with conditional form rendering - fixed by restructuring components
- TypeScript strict mode compliance with proper type definitions
- Complex variance calculation logic with positive/negative visual indicators
- Mobile-responsive design for delivery forms and performance reports
- Integration with existing orders workflow without breaking functionality
- React client component error in outstanding reports - fixed by extracting interactive buttons to separate client component

**Business Impact:**
- Complete delivery tracking replacing manual field reports
- Real-time variance tracking enables quality control and optimization
- Performance analytics provide insights into delivery efficiency
- Professional reporting supports operational decision making
- Mobile-friendly interfaces support field delivery confirmation
- Comprehensive audit trail for all delivery transactions
- Change the orders page button to link directly to /dashboard/reports instead of the non-existent orders/reports route

**System Performance:**
- Build process: Zero TypeScript errors, ESLint compliant
- Bundle optimization: Delivery pages 165kB-205kB first load
- Database operations: Efficient queries with proper indexing
- Mobile responsiveness: Tested across all delivery interfaces
- Real-time statistics: Optimized calculation performance

**Order-to-Delivery Workflow:**
1. **Order Generation**: Daily orders created with "Generated" status
2. **Delivery Selection**: Available orders displayed for delivery confirmation
3. **Delivery Confirmation**: Actual quantities recorded with variance calculation
4. **Status Update**: Orders marked as "Delivered" with delivery details
5. **Performance Tracking**: Analytics generated for reporting and optimization
