## Bug Fixes Session

### Issues Addressed
1. **Subscription Search Not Working**
   - **Problem**: Search functionality in `/dashboard/subscriptions` was throwing 500 errors
   - **Root Cause**: Incorrect `.or()` syntax when filtering across joined tables in Supabase
   - **Solution**: Changed from database-level filtering to client-side filtering for cross-table searches
   - **Files Modified**: `src/lib/actions/subscriptions.ts`

2. **Route Display Showing IDs Instead of Names**
   - **Problem**: Order generation preview was showing route UUIDs instead of readable route names
   - **Root Cause**: Customer queries weren't including the route relationship
   - **Solution**: Added `route:routes(*)` to customer relationship queries
   - **Files Modified**: `src/lib/actions/orders.ts`

### Technical Details

#### Search Fix
```typescript
// Before: Database-level filtering (failed)
.or(`customer.billing_name.ilike.%${query}%,customer.contact_person.ilike.%${query}%,product.name.ilike.%${query}%`)

// After: Client-side filtering (working)
const filteredData = (data || []).filter((subscription: any) => {
  const customer = subscription.customer
  const product = subscription.product
  const searchTerm = query.toLowerCase()
  
  return (
    customer?.billing_name?.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm) ||
    customer?.contact_person?.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm) ||
    product?.name?.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm)
  )
})
```

#### Route Display Fix
```typescript
// Before: Missing route relationship
customer:customers(*)

// After: Including route relationship
customer:customers(*, route:routes(*))
```

### Status
- ✅ Both issues resolved and tested successfully
- ✅ Build passes without errors
- ✅ User confirmed search functionality is working
- ✅ Route names now display properly in order generation preview

### Impact
- Subscription search is fully functional
- Order generation reports show readable route names instead of UUIDs
- Improved user experience in both features
